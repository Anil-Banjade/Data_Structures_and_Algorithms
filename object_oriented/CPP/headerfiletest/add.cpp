#include "add.h"
// Insert contents of add.h at this point.  Note use of double quotes here.
// Though it was included in tutorial but no need to include in this.
// It's better to include as This allows the compiler to catch certain kinds of errors at compile time instead of link time. For example:

 
int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
