* Binary Seach Tree

- Everything on left should be lesser than the node and everything on right should be greater than the node.
- Left and right subtree should itself be a bst.

- ideally duplicates are not allowed but in some cases there maybe.
  if we want duplicates, you can research. we can insert node or we can have node,freq members

- generally heights of bst are log2(N).
- L<N<R
