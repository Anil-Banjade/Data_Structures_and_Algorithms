* Linked List
- helps to increase as well as decrease it's size
- not in contigous location/sequential locations
- starting location of linked list is known as head
- last element is known as tail of linked list
- used in stack and queue not used in array
- used in browsers

** Working
- we are working on data as well as pointer so two things which data-type we don't know hence user-defined data type
  - we use struct or class.
    struct Node{
          int data;
	  Node* next;

	  Node(data1, next1){
	        data=data1
		next=next1;
	     }
	}

	- for initialization
	  Node x=Node(2,nullptr);
          Node* y=&x; //here y is the pointer to the location

	  or use
	  NOde* y=new Node(2,nullptr)
	  new pointer gives the pointer to a memory location i.e. address if we don't add new it just creates an object
	  so if you remove new and * and do cout y then it will give error, if you do y.data it will give 2 if you do y.next it will memory

	  if you create a pointer we will have to print y->data or y->next

	  *if Node y=Node (arr[0],nullptr), the object y is created so we can access data using y.data or y.next*
	  _if Node* y=new Node(arr[0],nullptr), the pointer to the object is created so we have to use y->data or y-> next, you can't use y.data_

	  
	  
	   

- so now how will data be stored
  - we are storing data and pointer
    - in 32 bit system, integer will take --> 4 bytes and pointer will take --> 4 byte so in total 8 bytes
    - in 64 bit system, integer will take --> 4 bytes and pointer will take --> 8 byte so in total 12 bytes
      - if we are adding one more int data to a struct then +4 in both so 12 and 16 byte resp.


- To traverse head
  - never tamper/change the head


- Delete node
  - Node* temp=head;
    head=head->next;
    free(temp); in cpp delete temp;
    return head;

*Given a linked list means head of linked list is given*

*Insertion at head means adding element before head if it has 5 elements then total elements will be 6*



* Doubly Linked List
